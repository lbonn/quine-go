quine-go
========

Some examples of simple quines in go.
Nothing new or even smart, just had some time to kill.

quine.go
--------

A classic quine using escaping tricks and trying to be compact (no linejump).
Not very pretty though...

quine64.go
----------

Thanks to go extensive standard library, it is very easy to write a quine
using a base64 encoding of the code. To rebuild it, just use:

    $  make clean && make

Tests
-----

A failed quine is pretty sad.
Just run:

    $  make check

to verify that everything is in order.
