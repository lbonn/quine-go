quine-go
========

Some examples of simple quines in go.
Nothing new or even smart, just had some time to kill.

quine.go
--------

Simple quine, trying to be as compact as possible.
Uses the '%q' format verb to avoid re-escaping the code by hand.

size: 118 bytes

quine64.go
----------

Thanks to go extensive standard library, it is very easy to write a quine
using a base64 encoding of the code. To rebuild it, just use:

    $  make clean && make

size: 278 bytes

quinefmt.go
-----------

This quine tries to pass through gofmt without being modified. Unsurprisingly, it is significantly larger than the minimal one.

size: 163 bytes

e.go
----

Slightly degenerate version. Triggers a syntax error message identical to the
source file.

This is tuned to work with the standard go compiler version 1.1 and can break very easily (just rename the file).

It has a short and unexplicit file name to minimize its size.

size: 47 bytes


Tests
-----

A failed quine is pretty sad.
Just run:

    $  make check

to verify that everything is in order.

Others
------

I will happily accept tricks to make these quines shorter, if you do
not have something better to do :).
